# Conflict Rule 4
## Outpost striking is not allowed.

Faction outposts (e.g., Camelot Station) are [color=red][bold]not allowed[/bold][/color] to be striked until the shift duration has hit [color=yellow]four (4) hours[/color].

[italic]This initial "grace period" is designed to provide factions with a window to establish themselves and engage in roleplay before facing attacks.[/italic]

- For clarity, a "strike" in this context refers to any (organized or unorganized) hostile action intended to damage outposts, seize control, eliminate its occupants, or damage docked ships.

- Colonial Outpost (CO) and Medical Dispatch (MD) are [color=green]recognized safe zones[/color], meaning they are [color=red][bold]never allowed[/bold][/color] to be striked.
